or \texttt{\textasciitilde{}/.rigsofrods/mods} on Linux:

\textbf{NEVER extract the zip file unless specifically mentioned in the
file description! I cannot stress this enough.}

You can organize your mods with subfolders.
(e.g.~\texttt{mods\textbackslash{}vehicles\textbackslash{}DodgeViperGTS.zip})

That's it! You can launch Rigs of Rods now and your shiny new mod should
be ready to use.

To install packs (a zip file containing multiple zips inside) such as
the
\href{http://forum.rigsofrods.org/resources/gabester-vehicle-pack.12/}{Gabester
Vehicle Pack} or the
\href{http://archives.rigsofrods.net/contentpacks/}{content packs}, just
extract the zip into the \texttt{mods} folder.

\hypertarget{installing-skinzips}{%
\section{Installing skinzips}\label{installing-skinzips}}

Some mods may provide a \texttt{*.skinzip} which contains some extra
liveries/skins for the vehicle. To install these, just place them inside
the \texttt{mods} folder.

For more information about skinzips, see
\href{/vehicle-creation/alternate-skins/}{this page}.

These are files meant to be used by photo editing programs such as
Photoshop or paint.net, they are not meant to be placed in the RoR
directories.
